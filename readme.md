## SWBFII Shader Patch
This project is aimed at enabling the writing of more advanced shaders for Star Wars Battlefront II (2005). It does
things like expose additional shader constants, access to additional textures or performing other actions at key points
during the game's rendering process.

This repository is a counterpart to [shaderpatch](https://github.com/SleepKiller/swbfii_shader_toolkit/tree/shaderpatch)
branch of the swbfii_shader_toolkit repository.

More complete documentation and build instructions coming soonâ„¢.
