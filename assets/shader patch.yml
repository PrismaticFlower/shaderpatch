   Resolution: [1920, 1080]

   # When running in a window whether or not to make the window borderless,

   Borderless: yes

Rendering:
   # Enable or disable high resolution water reflections.
   HighResolutionReflections: yes

   # Enable or disable replacing the stock bloom effect with one that gives smoother,
   # less blocky results while maintaining radius and intensity.
   SmoothBloom: yes

   # Enable or disable replacing the blur that blur particles use with a gaussian blur.
   # This may come at a slight performance cost but may give nicer results.
   GaussianBlurBlurParticles: yes
   
   # Enable or disable replacing the scene blur effect some maps use with a gaussian blur.
   # Once again this may come at a slight performance cost but is definitely 
   # capable of giving nicer results. In some rare cases it may break the art style of a map.
   GaussianSceneBlur: yes

   # Scale of the water reflection buffer (regardless of HighResolutionReflections), 
   # in range [0.01...1.0]. Higher is better but may come at a cost in performance.
   ReflectionBufferScale: 0.5

   # Scale of the refraction buffer used for effects like water and the Droideka's shield, 
   # in range [0.01...1.0].  Higher is better but may come at a cost in performance.
   RefractionBufferScale: 0.5

   # Set the desired max samples for anisotropic filtering. Higher is better, but _may_ come at a performance cost.
   # Will be clamped to [1, DeviceMax],  typically DeviceMax will be 16.
   AnisotropicFiltering: 16
   
   # Force anisotropic filtering on for stock textures that use linear downsampling.
   # This has no affect on Shader Patch custom materials.
   ForceAnisotropicFiltering: yes
   
   # Enable or disable advertising Shader Patch's presence to mods.
   AdvertisePresence: yes

# Settings for the Effects system, which allows modders to apply various effects
# to their mods at their discretion and configuration. Below are options provided to 
# tweak the performance of this system for low-end/older GPUs.
Effects:
   # For some _very_ old or _very_ low-end GPUs the Effects system may prove too much to handle
   # at an acceptable framerate and in this case this can be used to switch them off.
   Enabled: yes
   
   # Sets quality of the color depth used for render targets when Effects system is active and HDR Rendering isn't
   # enabled. 
   # Can be "normal", "high" or "ultra".
   # There is likely a definite performance cost to having this set to "ultra" and a possible slight performance 
   # cost to "high". If in dire need of better performance try out "normal" and see if it helps.
   ColorQuality: high
   
   # Set the quality of AA done on maps where the Effects system is active. 
   # Can be "fastest", "fast", "slower", or "slowest". 
   # Pessimistically set to "fastest" by default. If you feel confident in your GPU's capabilities you 
   # can probably go ahead and set this to "slower" ot "slowest", obivously setting it back if you get lag.
   #
   # It can also be set to "none" to disable post processing AA outright. The exact on speedup gained by
   # this will likely vary based on GPU, resolution, etc 
   #
   # As a point of reference I tested on my Nvidia GPU and got a slight speedup by setting this to "none". But the game's 
   # FPS was already in the hundreds so it mattered little. 
   #
   # While on my Intel GPU I observed no change in performance between "none" and "fastest". (The FPS went 
   # from ~32 to... ~32). But by all means set this to "none" if you need the best performance possible, just don't
   # be surprised if it has less impact than you'd like.
   PostAAQuality: fastest
   
   # Enable or disable a mod using the Soft Shadows effect. This is the most expensive effect and 
   # the first you should switch off.
   SoftShadows: yes
   
   # Enable or disable a mod using the Bloom effect. This effect is cheap and there is likely
   # little FPS to be gained from switching it off. Still if you're hitting really low FPS (let's say under 40) having 
   # it off can increase the framerate by afew a second.
   Bloom: yes
   
   # Enable or disable a mod using the Vignette effect. This effect is really cheap and there is likely
   # no FPS to be gained from switching it off. But if you're in truely dire need... (Though it is probably better to 
   # just set Enabled to 'no'.)
   Vignette: yes
   
   # Enable or disable a mod using the Film Grain effect. This either falls in the same baskest as Bloom or can 
   # actually be worse when Colored Film Grain is being used. (A mod controls if it is or not.) 
   FilmGrain: yes
   
   # Enable or disable a mod using being allowed to use Colored Film Grain. For mods that 
   # use it colored film grain can definitely looks nicer. However it is more costly to performance to evaluate
   # it and on low-end GPUs you may wish to switch this off.
   AllowColoredFilmGrain: yes

Developer:
   # Toggle key for the developer screen. Giving access to useful things for mod makers and
   # Shader Patch developers alike.
   #
   # The value identifies the virtual key that activates the debug screen, below are some common values
   # for you to choose from. (Copy and paste the value on the right of your desired key.)
   #
   # '~': 0xC0 
   # '\': 0xDC 
   # 'Backspace': 0x08 
   # 'F12': 0x7B
   ScreenToggle: 0xDC
   
   # Controls whether or not Shader Patch will attempt to remove the game's FPS cap. This is in part mostly here
   # for people going on performance testing adventures.  As there are certain parts of the game whose simulation 
   # is tied to framerate, in particular UI animation, cloth and bizarrely the physics of hover vehicles.
   # If those downsides sounds acceptable to you then feel free to switch this on.
