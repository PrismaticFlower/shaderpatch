# This can be used to disable Shader Patch (for say, testing purposes) without uninstalling it.
Shader Patch Enabled: yes

Display:
   # Precentage of the sceen the game's window will take up. Value from 10 to 100.
   Screen Percent: 100

   # Allow tearing when displaying frames. This allows lower latency and is a prerequisite for 
   # variable refresh rate technologies to work with Shader Patch.
   Allow Tearing: yes
   
   # Whether to centre the window or not. If `ScreenPercent` is 100 there will be 
   # no difference between a centred and uncentred window.
   Centred: yes

Graphics:
   # Anti-Aliasing method to use, can be "none", "" "MSAAx2", "MSAAx4" or "MSAAx8".
   Anti-Aliasing Method: MSAAx4

   # Anisotropic Filtering level for textures, can be "off", "x2", "x4", "x8" or "x16".
   Anisotropic Filtering: x16

# Settings for the Effects system, which allows modders to apply various effects
# to their mods at their discretion and configuration. Below are options provided to 
# tweak the performance of this system for low-end/older GPUs.
Effects:
   # For some _very_ old or _very_ low-end GPUs the Effects system may prove too much to handle
   # at an acceptable framerate and in this case this can be used to switch them off.
   Enabled: yes
   
   # Enable or disable a mod using the Bloom effect. This effect is cheap and there is likely
   # little FPS to be gained from switching it off. Still if you're hitting really low FPS (let's say under 40) having 
   # it off can increase the framerate by a few a second.
   Bloom: yes
   
   # Enable or disable a mod using the Vignette effect. This effect is really cheap and there is likely
   # no FPS to be gained from switching it off. But if you're in truely dire need... (Though it is probably better to 
   # just set Enabled to 'no'.)
   Vignette: yes
   
   # Enable or disable a mod using the Film Grain effect. This either falls in the same baskest as Bloom or can 
   # actually be worse when Colored Film Grain is being used. (A mod controls if it is or not.) 
   Film Grain: yes
   
   # Enable or disable a mod using being allowed to use Colored Film Grain. For mods that 
   # use it colored film grain can definitely looks nicer. However it is more costly to performance to evaluate
   # it and on low-end GPUs you may wish to switch this off.
   Allow Colored Film Grain: yes 
   
Developer:   
   # Toggle key for the developer screen. Giving access to useful things for mod makers and
   # Shader Patch developers alike.
   #
   # The value identifies the virtual key that activates the debug screen, below are some common values
   # for you to choose from. (Copy and paste the value on the right of your desired key.)
   #
   # '~': 0xC0 
   # '\': 0xDC 
   # 'Backspace': 0x08 
   # 'F12': 0x7B
   Screen Toggle: 0xDC
   
   # Controls whether or not Shader Patch will attempt to remove the game's FPS cap. This is in part mostly here
   # for people going on performance testing adventures.  As there are certain parts of the game whose simulation 
   # is tied to framerate, in particular UI animation, cloth and bizarrely the physics of hover vehicles.
   # If those downsides sounds acceptable to you then feel free to switch this on.
   Unlock FPS: no
   
   # Controls whether or not Shader Patch will allow the game to use GPU event queries.
   Allow Event Queries: no
   
   # Enable the D3D11 debug layer, typically requires the Windows SDK to be installed to work.
   # Even if this flag is true the debug layer will only be enabled if a debugger is attached to the game.
   Use D3D11 Debug Layer: no
