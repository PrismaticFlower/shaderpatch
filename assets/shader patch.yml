Developer:
   # Controls whether or not Shader Patch will attempt to remove the game's FPS cap. This is in part mostly here
   # for people going on performance testing adventures.  As there are certain parts of the game whose simulation 
   # is tied to framerate, in particular UI animation, cloth and bizarrely the physics of hover vehicles.
   # If those downsides sounds acceptable to you then feel free to switch this on.
   UnlockFPS: no
