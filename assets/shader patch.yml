Shader Patch Enabled: yes

Display: 

   # Turn V-Sync on or off. The game's own setting for this is currently ignored.
   V-Sync: yes

   # Whether 800x600 will be treated as the resolution used by the game's main menu interface. When
   # enabled causes Shader Patch to override the game's resolution without informing the game it has done so.
   # Doing this keeps the interface usable while still letting you enjoy fullscreen ingame.
   Treat 800x600 As Interface: yes

   # When Treat 800x600 As Interface is enabled controls if the interface will be stretched across the
   # screen or if it's 4:3 aspect ratio will be maintained using black bars.
   Stretch Interface: no

   # Whether to mark the game DPI aware or not. When your display scaling is not at 100% having this be
   # `yes` keeps the game being drawn at native resolution and stops Windows' upscaling it after the fact.
   Display Scaling Aware: yes

   # When `Display Scaling Aware` is `yes` controls if the game's perceived resolution will be scaled
   # based on the display scaling factor. This effectively adjusts the scale UI and HUD elements are
   # positioned and drawn with to match the display's scale.
   Display Scaling: yes

   # When `Display Scaling Aware` is `yes` controls if the game's perceived resolution will be scaled
   # based on if Shader Patch detects Dynamic Super Resolution/Virtual Super Resolution being used. The
   # detection is based on if the game's resolution increases past the starting desktop resolution.
   DSR-VSR Display Scaling: yes

   # Whether to replace the game's core fonts with ones that can be scaled. If you have any mods
   # installed that also replace the game's fonts when this setting is enabled then they will be superseded by
   # Shader Patch's fonts.
   Scalable Fonts: yes

   # Enables a "hack" (or series of) to override the game's aspect ratio while keeping the HUD visible.
   # It's not perfect but can make the game far more playable at ultrawide aspect ratios than it otherwise
   # would be.
   # 
   # This feature will search the memory around the "D3DPRESENT_PARAMETERS" it passes to
   # "IDirect3DDevice9::Reset" for the aspect ratio. It is able to successfully find it on all versions of the game I have
   # (DVD/GoG/Steam/Modtools) and no other values in the area seem to resemble anything looking like an aspect ratio. Which
   # should make it quite reliable. But there is always the tiny chance it'll end up overwriting some random
   # pointer and cause all sorts of fun (hopefully just a crash but who knows), so use at your own risk and all
   # that. This is the only feature in SP to depend on reading or writing a value in the game's memory. And
   # it will NEVER do it unless this is explicitly enabled.
   # 
   # Loading screens will often appear distorted when using this.
   # 
   # See and configure Aspect Ratio Hack HUD Handling below as well.
   Aspect Ratio Hack: no

   # How to handle the HUD when using the Aspect Ratio Hack. Can be "Stretch 4_3", "Centre 4_3",
   # "Stretch 16_9" or "Centre 16_9".
   # 
   # In Stretch mode the HUD will be stretched out across the entire screen. This can look acceptable
   # depending on the amount of stretching, a 4:3 HUD stretched to 32:9 will look worse than a 16:9 HUD stretched
   # to the same.
   # 
   # In Centre mode the HUD will be drawn into the centre of the screen with the correct aspect ratio.
   # Mostly, some elements like the crosshair ammo counter and weapon heat will be misaligned and potentially
   # stretched.
   Aspect Ratio Hack HUD Handling: Centre 4_3

   # Enables the overriding the resolution the game thinks it is rendering at, without changing the
   # resolution it is actually rendered at. This can have the affect of altering the aspect ratio of the game and
   # the scaling and position of UI/HUD elements.
   # 
   # When set to `yes` causes `Display Scaling` to be ignored.
   # 
   # If you're unsure what this is useful for then **leave** it set to "no".
   Enable Game Perceived Resolution Override: no

   # The override for the game's perceived resolution, for use with `Enable Game Perceived Resolution
   # Override`.
   Game Perceived Resolution Override: [1920, 1080]

   # Enables the overriding the resolution the game will be rendered at to a percentage of the
   # monitor's resolution. This is mostly intended for use with modtools' debug .exe.
   Override Resolution: no

   # When Override Resolution is enabled the percentage of the screen the game's window will take up.
   Override Resolution Screen Percent: 100

User Interface: 

   # Extra scaling for the UI/HUD on top of normal display scaling. As a percentage. This can be used
   # to make text larger if it is too small but only has effect when Display Scaling is enabled.
   # 
   # Note that the trick Shader Patch uses to scale the game's UI (lowering the resolution the game
   # thinks it's rendering at) can't scale indefinitely, if changing this has to effect and you're on a high
   # DPI screen it's possible you've hit the limit for how much scaling Shader Patch can allow.
   Extra UI Scaling: 150

   # Color to use for Friend HUD and world elemenets. (Command Posts, crosshair, etc)
   Friend Color: [1, 86, 213]

   # Color to use for Foe HUD and world elemenets. (Command Posts, crosshair, etc)
   Foe Color: [223, 32, 32]

Graphics: 

   # How to select the GPU to use. Can be "Highest Performance", "Lowest Power Usage", "Highest Feature
   # Level", "Most Memory" or "Use CPU".
   GPU Selection Method: Highest Performance

   # Anti-Aliasing method to use, can be "none", "CMAA2", "MSAAx4" or "MSAAx8".
   Anti-Aliasing Method: CMAA2

   # Enables supersampling the alpha test for hardedged transparency/alpha cutouts when Multisampling
   # Anti-Aliasing is enabled.
   # 
   # This provides excellent anti-aliasing for alpha cutouts (foliage, flat fences, etc) and should be
   # much cheaper than general supersampling. It however does raise the number of texture samples that need
   # to be taken by however many rendertarget samples there are - fast high end GPUs may not even notice
   # this, low power mobile GPUs may struggle more.
   # 
   # If enabling this causes performance issues but you'd still really like it then lowering the level
   # of Anisotropic Filtering may help make reduce the performance cost of this option.
   Supersample Alpha Test: no

   # Anisotropic Filtering level for textures, can be "off", "x2", "x4", "x8" or "x16".
   Anisotropic Filtering: x16

   # Controls whether R1G16B16A16 rendertargets will be used or not. Due to the way SWBFII is drawn
   # using them can cut down significantly on banding. Additionally when they are enabled dithering will be
   # applied when they are copied into R8G8B8A8 textures for display to further reduce banding.
   # 
   # If Effects are enabled and HDR rendering is enabled by a map then this setting has no effect.
   Enable 16-Bit Color Channel Rendering: no

   # Enables the use of an Order-Independent Transparency approximation. It should go without saying
   # that this increases the cost of rendering. Requires a GPU with support for Rasterizer Ordered Views and
   # typed Unordered Access View loads.
   # 
   # When this is enabled transparent objects will no longer be affected by Multisample Anti-Aliasing
   # (MSAA), this can be especially noticeable when using resolution scaling - although it does depend on the
   # map. Postprocessing Anti-Aliasing options like CMAA2 are unaffected.
   # 
   # Known to be buggy on old NVIDIA drivers. Try updating your GPU driver if you encounter issues.
   Enable Order-Independent Transparency: no

   # Enables the use of an alternative post processing path for some of the game's post processing
   # effects. The benefit to this is the alternative path is designed to be independent of the game's resolution
   # and is unaffected by bugs the vanilla path suffers from relating to high resolutions.
   # 
   # In some cases the alternative path may produce results that do not exactly match the intended look
   # of a map.
   Enable Alternative Post Processing: yes

   # Allows the use of Shader Patch's soft skinning shaders. This makes compatible assets appear
   # smoother when being animated.
   # 
   # There is a very, very small chance of compatibility issues from using this. If in the unlikely
   # event you get unusual looking player models with Shader Patch (but not without) then turning this off
   # may solve it.
   Allow Vertex Soft Skinning: yes

   # Enables maps to make use of the game's scene blur effect. Has a performance cost but using it will
   # keep the map's artwork more inline with the creators vision. Note this is **unrelated** to the Effects
   # system and also only takes effect when `Enable Alternative Post Processing` is `yes`.
   Enable Scene Blur: yes

   # Quality level of refractions. Can be "Low", "Medium", "High" or "Ultra".
   # "Low" sets the resolution of the refractions to 1/4 screen resolution, Medium 1/2, High 1/2 and
   # Ultra matches screen resolution.
   # 
   # On "High" or "Ultra" refractions will also be masked using the depth buffer.
   Refraction Quality: Medium

   # In the vanilla shaders for most surfaces after calculating incoming light for a surface the
   # brightness of the light is rescaled to keep it from being too dark or too bright. (Or at least that is what I
   # *assume* the reason to be.)
   # 
   # Disabling this can increase the realism and correctness of lighting for objects lit by the
   # affected shaders. But for maps/mods that have had their lighting carefully balanced by the author it could
   # do more harm than good. It is also likely to increase the amount of surfaces that are bright enough
   # to cause light bloom in a scene.
   # 
   # This setting has no affect on custom materials or when Effects are enabled. (Effects have an
   # equivalent setting however.)
   Disable Light Brightness Rescaling: no

   # When a map or mod has not loaded an Effects Config Shader Patch can use a user specified config.
   Enable User Effects Config: no

   # The name of the Effects Config to load when `Enable User Effects Config` is true. The config
   # should be in the same directory as the game's executable.
   User Effects Config: user.spfx

   # Like Enable User Effects Config except SP will automatically check for a config named "shader
   # patch.spfx". If it exists Shader Patch will load it and activate Effects.
   Enable Auto User Effects Config: yes

   # Force using Direct3D 11 on 12 instead of the any native Direct3D 11 driver. This can workaround
   # bugs in the D3D11 driver. It is likely that turning this on will cost some performance however. CMAA2
   # is also broken while using this (unsure why, there are no debug layer errors from D3D11 or D3D12
   # about it).
   Use Direct3D 11 on 12: no

Effects: 

   # Enable or disable a mod using the Bloom effect. This effect is can have a slight performance
   # impact.
   Bloom: yes

   # Enable or disable a mod using the Vignette effect. This effect is really cheap.
   Vignette: yes

   # Enable or disable a mod using the Film Grain effect. This effect is fairly cheap.
   Film Grain: yes

   # Enable or disable a mod using being allowed to use Colored Film Grain. Slightly more expensive
   # than just regular Film Grain, if a mod is using it.
   Allow Colored Film Grain: yes

   # Enable or disable a mod using Screen Space Ambient Occlusion. (Not actually true Ambient Occlusion
   # as it is applied indiscriminately to opaque surfaces.)
   # 
   # Has anywhere from a slight performance impact to significant performance impact depending on the
   # quality setting.
   SSAO: yes

   # Quality of SSAO when enabled. Can be "Fastest", "Fast", Medium", "High" or "Highest". Each step up
   # is usually 1.5x-2.0x more expensive than the last setting.
   SSAO Quality: Medium

   # Enable or disable a mod using the Depth of Field effect.
   # 
   # Has anywhere from a slight performance impact to significant performance impact depending on the
   # quality setting.
   Depth of Field: yes

   # Quality of the Depth of Field effect when enabled.
   # 
   # Can be "Ultra Performance", "Performance", "Quality" or "Ultra Quality". Ultra Quality is
   # significantly more expensive than Quality.
   Depth of Field Quality: Quality
