   # When running in a window whether or not to make the window borderless, 
   # works regardless of what Enabled is set to.
   Borderless: yes

Rendering:
   # Enable or disable high resolution water reflections.
   HighResolutionReflections: yes

   # Enable or disable replacing the stock bloom effect with one that gives smoother,
   # less blocky results while maintaining radius and intensity.
   SmoothBloom: yes

   # Enable or disable replacing the blur that blur particles use with a gaussian blur.
   # This may come at a slight performance cost but may give nicer results.
   GaussianBlurBlurParticles: yes
   
   # Enable or disable replacing the scene blur effect some maps use with a gaussian blur.
   # Once again this may come at a slight performance cost but is definitely 
   # capable of giving nicer results. In some rare cases it may break the art style of a map.
   GaussianSceneBlur: yes

   # Enable or disable fake soft shadows.
   SoftShadows: yes
   
   # Scale of the water reflection buffer (regardless of HighResolutionReflections), 
   # in range [0.01...1.0]. Higher is better but may come at a cost in performance.
   ReflectionBufferScale: 0.5

   # Scale of the refraction buffer used for effects like water and the Droideka's shield, 
   # in range [0.01...1.0].  Higher is better but may come at a cost in performance.
   RefractionBufferScale: 0.5

   # Set the desired max samples for anisotropic filtering. Higher is better, but _may_ come at a performance cost.
   # Will be clamped to [1, DeviceMax],  typically DeviceMax will be 16.
   AnisotropicFiltering: 16
   
   # Set the quality of AA done on maps where the Effects system is active. 
   # Can be "fastest", "fast", "slower", or "slowest". 
   # Pessimistically set to "fastest" by default. If you feel confident in your GPU's capabilities you 
   # can probably go ahead and set this to "slow" ot "slowest", obivously setting it back if you get lag.
   PostAAQuality: fastest
   
   # Force anisotropic filtering on for stock textures that use linear downsampling.
   # This has no affect on Shader Patch custom materials.
   ForceAnisotropicFiltering: yes
   
   # Enable or disable advertising Shader Patch's presence to mods.
   AdvertisePresence: yes

Game:
   # Controls whether or not Shader Patch will attempt to remove the game's FPS cap. 
   # The animation speed of certain UI elements is stuffed up by this, but the game itself is stable.
   UnlockFPS: yes
