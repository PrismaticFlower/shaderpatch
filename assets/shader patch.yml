Window:
   # Precentage of the sceen the game's window will take up. Value from 10 to 100.
   ScreenPercent: 100

   # Allow tearing when displaying frames. This allows lower latency and is a prerequisite for 
   # variable refresh rate technologies to work with Shader Patch.
   AllowTearing: yes
   
   # Whether to centre the window or not. If `ScreenPercent` is 100 there will be 
   # no difference between a centred and uncentred window.
   Centred: yes
   
Developer:
   # Controls whether or not Shader Patch will attempt to remove the game's FPS cap. This is in part mostly here
   # for people going on performance testing adventures.  As there are certain parts of the game whose simulation 
   # is tied to framerate, in particular UI animation, cloth and bizarrely the physics of hover vehicles.
   # If those downsides sounds acceptable to you then feel free to switch this on.
   UnlockFPS: no
   
   # Controls whether or not Shader Patch will allow the game to use GPU event queries.
   AllowEventQueries: no
   
   ForceD3D11DebugLayer: no
