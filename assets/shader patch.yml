# This can be used to disable Shader Patch (for say, testing purposes) without uninstalling it.
Shader Patch Enabled: yes

Display:
   # Precentage of the sceen the game's window will take up. Value from 10 to 100.
   Screen Percent: 100

   # Allow tearing when displaying frames. This can allow lower latency and is also required for 
   # variable refresh rate technologies to work.
   Allow Tearing: no
   
   # Whether to centre the window or not. If `ScreenPercent` is 100 there will be 
   # no difference between a centred and uncentred window.
   Centred: yes

   # Whether 800x600 will be treated as the resolution used by interface. When enabled causes
   # Shader Patch to NOT change the game's resolution when it is set to 800x600. Doing this keeps 
   # the interface usable while still letting you enjoy fullscreen ingame.
   Treat 800x600 As Interface: yes

Graphics:
   # How to select the GPU to use. Can be "Highest Performance", "Lowest Power Usage", "Highest Feature Level", "Most Memory" or "Use CPU".
   GPU Selection Method: Highest Performance

   # Anti-Aliasing method to use, can be "none", "CMAA2", "MSAAx2", "MSAAx4" or "MSAAx8".
   Anti-Aliasing Method: CMAA2

   # Anisotropic Filtering level for textures, can be "off", "x2", "x4", "x8" or "x16".
   Anisotropic Filtering: x16
   
   # Controls whether R1G16B16A16 rendertargets will be used or not. Due to the way SWBFII is drawn using them can cut down significantly
   # on banding. Additionally when they are enabled dithering will be applied when they are copied into R8G8B8A8 textures for display to further reduce banding.
   #
   # If Effects are enabled and HDR rendering is enabled by a map then this setting has no effect.
   Enable 16-Bit Color Channel Rendering: yes

   # Enables the use of an Order-Independent Transparency approximation. It should go without saying that this increases the cost of rendering.
   # Requires a GPU with support for Rasterizer Ordered Views and typed Unordered Access View loads. Known to be buggy on NVIDIA GPUs.
   Enable Order-Independent Transparency: no

   # Enables the use of an alternative post processing path for the some of the game's post processing effects. The benefit to this 
   # is the alternative path is designed to be independent of the game's resolution and is unaffected by bugs the vanilla path suffers
   # from relating to high resolutions.
   # 
   # In some rare cases the alternative path may produce results that do not exactly match the intended look of a map.
   Enable Alternative Post Processing: yes

   # Whether to let custom materials use tessellation shaders or not. On older GPUs this
   # may cause a performance hit.
   Enable Tessellation: yes

   # When a map or mod has not loaded an Effects Config Shader Patch can use a user specified 
   # config.
   Enable User Effects Config: no

   # The name of the Effects Config to load when `Enable User Effects Config` is true. The config
   # should be in the same directory as the game's executable.
   User Effects Config: user.spfx

# Settings for the Effects system, which allows modders to apply various effects
# to their mods at their discretion and configuration. Below are options provided to 
# tweak the performance of this system for low-end/older GPUs.
Effects:
   # For some _very_ old or _very_ low-end GPUs the Effects system may prove too much to handle
   # at an acceptable framerate and in this case this can be used to switch them off.
   Enabled: yes
   
   # Enable or disable a mod using the Bloom effect. This effect is can have a slight performance impact.
   Bloom: yes
   
   # Enable or disable a mod using the Vignette effect. This effect is really cheap.
   Vignette: yes
   
   # Enable or disable a mod using the Film Grain effect. This effect is fairly cheap.
   Film Grain: yes
   
   # Enable or disable a mod using being allowed to use Colored Film Grain. Slightly more expensive than just 
   # regular Film Grain, if a mod is using it.
   Allow Colored Film Grain: yes 
   
   # Enable or disable a mod using Screen Space Ambient Occlusion. (Not actually true Ambient Occlusion as 
   # it is applied indiscriminately to opaque surfaces.)
   # Has anywhere from a slight performance impact to significant performance impact depending on the quality setting.
   SSAO: yes
   
   # Quality of SSAO when enabled. Can be "Fastest", "Fast", Medium", "High" or "Highest".
   # Each step up is usually 1.5x-2.0x more expensive than the last setting.
   SSAO Quality: Medium
   
Developer:   
   # Toggle key for the developer screen. Giving access to useful things for mod makers and
   # Shader Patch developers alike.
   #
   # The value identifies the virtual key that activates the debug screen, below are some common values
   # for you to choose from. (Copy and paste the value on the right of your desired key.)
   #
   # '~': 0xC0 
   # '\': 0xDC 
   # 'Backspace': 0x08 
   # 'F12': 0x7B
   Screen Toggle: 0xDC
   
   # Controls whether or not Shader Patch will allow the game to use GPU event queries.
   Allow Event Queries: no
   
   # Enable the D3D11 debug layer, typically requires the Windows SDK to be installed to work.
   # Even if this flag is true the debug layer will only be enabled if a debugger is attached to the game.
   Use D3D11 Debug Layer: no

   # Limit Shader Patch to using a DXGI 1.2 factory to work around a crash in the 
   # Visual Studio Graphics Debugger. This also bypasses all GPU selection logic.
   Use DXGI 1.2 Factory: no
